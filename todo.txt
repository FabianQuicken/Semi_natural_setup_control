motion_detection func:
- detect motion change (cs2.absdiff)
- make the threshold adjustable with cv2.threshold
- sum up the change that exceeds the threshold and return true if change is significant enough
- pass an argument to the func that allows to open a window to visualize the motion detection

in a loop, test motion detection for each camera (maybe only for top or side camera?)

introduce a "module" class?
class can contain cameras

record_video func:
- when motion_detection returns true, video should be record_video
- both cameras for the module should be activated
